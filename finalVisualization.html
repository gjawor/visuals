				Our project focuses on youth survey data collected during the 2019-2020 school year from 36 Mass Promise Fellowship
				program sites. Before starting the MPF at their specific sites, middle school and high school aged youth took part in a
				pre-survey to gather data about how they felt about school and life in general. Unfortunately in the spring when
				coronavirus forced schools to go online, MPF had to halt its programs, but sent out the post-survey to be distributed.
				Due to the complicated nature of the spring, there are not an equal amount of pre and post surveys for most sites, but
				there is still a lot of valuable data and conclusions that can be drawn from both.

				Our visualizations represent a lot of data, and reference emotional and cognitive engagement. These engagement scores
				are based on a study in Iceland, Scales based on article A bifactor model of school engagement: assessing general and
				specific aspects of behavioral, emotional and cognitive engagement among adolescents by Kristjan K Stefansson, Steinunn
				Gestsdottir, et al. The study uses particular questions to measure engagement, and the overall scores are a calculated
				average from 1-5. The statements in the survey used for emotional engagement are:</p>
				<ol style="margin-left: 5cm; margin-right: 5cm;">
					<li>I feel part of my school</li>
					<li>I care about the school I go to</li>
					<li>I am happy to be at my school</li>
					<li>I find school fun and exciting</li>
					<li>I enjoy the classes I am taking</li>
				</ol>
				<p style="margin-left: 5cm; margin-right: 5cm;">
					The statements used for cognitive engagements are
				</p>
				<ol style="margin-left: 5cm; margin-right: 5cm;">
					<li>I want to learn as much as I can in school</li>
					<li>I think it is important to make good grades</li>
					<li>I think the things I learn at school are useful</li>
					<li>I think a lot about how to do well in school</li>
					<li>School is very important for later success</li>
				</ol>
				<p style="margin-left: 5cm; margin-right: 5cm;">
					Although these questions are not directly connected to MPF, they are quite important when considering the work of MPF,
					as the program is meant to uplift students academically and emotionally, ideally with improvement in both scores over
					time.

					This first visualization shows emotional and cognitive engagement based on how long the program worked at each site, as
					well as if the students worked directly with a fellow or not. It explores both pre and post survey data to show how the
					impact of a fellow changed engagement scores over time.

				This parallel coordinates chart shows various metrics of
				interest by school. Each line represents a different MPF site
				(click on a line to see which MPF site it represents!). The
				point at which the line intersects with the axis represents the
				average score that the program participants filled out in the
				form at each respective school. You can read more about parallel
				coordinates charts here: <a href="https:

				This second visualization shows all post survey results, looking
				at the average score for each site. This visualization adds in
				adult planning scores as well as adult academic scores. These
				scores are based on questions that ask about how comfortable
				students feel talking with adults about their future plans, and
				how they feel supported to take on the next stages of their life
				whether it involve college, working, or both.

				This visualization uses histograms to show the individual scores
				that each site received for emotional and cognitive engagement,
				and how frequent they were. This is particularly helpful to
				sites to see what they may need to improve on to strengthen the
				impact of their program.
